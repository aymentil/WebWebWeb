# Setup example
Let's break down this example of a GET route in FastAPI.

```py
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

@app.get('/beans')
def eat_beans():
  print('Nom nom')
  return { 'message': 'I love beans!' }
```

When you open a web browser and visit a URL, like `fsektionen.se/sida/styrdokument` the browser sends a <em>request</em> to that URL and shows you the <em>response</em>. The URL part `/sida/styrdokument` is called path or route.

We want to define a function on our server to run everytime we receive a request to a route. For this we define a normal python function.

```py
def eat_beans():
  print('Nom nom')
  return
```

How will this run when receiving a request? 

`
@app.get('/beans')
` is a decorator telling our framework, FastAPI, that this function should be called upon every request to `/beans`


We don't have a response yet! For every request we should return a response. Our response is whatever we `return` in our function.

```py
return { 'message', 'I love beans!'}
```

We may return anything we wish, but Python dicts are converted to JSON which is the common format.
