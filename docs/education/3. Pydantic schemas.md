# Schemas example

Let's have a look at `Schemas` in FastAPI. 

If we look back at example 2, a body of type `dict[str , str]` would not be very helpful! Instead, we will use Pydantic to structure our request and response data. FastAPI uses these Pydantic models for validating that the request body is what we want, and that our response is what we intend. In this tutorial, we will  define all schemas in a file called `schemas.py`.

```py
from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict

# Inherit from when creating Pydantic Models
class BaseSchema(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)
    # This model_config lets pydantic validate a databse model


class User(BaseSchema):
    email: str
    name: str | None #A string or None
    password: str
```
Like the previous example, want to make signup POST route. But this time, we create a user object containing a user email, name and password. 

```py
user_list: list[User] = []

@app.post("/signup")
def sign_up(user: User):
    user_list.append(user)
    return user
```

Using a Pydantic model (or *schema* as we'll call it) the HTTP body sent along with the POST request will be validated by the framework, FastAPI. It will make sure the data is structured according to our `User` schema. If it's not, the client recieves a helpful error, telling them that we want a body like `User`.

Additionally, you typically want the response to be the data that you just created. We want to structure the response. This can be done using response models. 

```py
class UserOut(BaseSchema):
    email: str
    name: str | None
```

In this example, the UserOut model doesn't include the password because, usually, returning the password isn't something that the response should include. 

```py
from schemas import UserOut

user_list: list[User] = []

@app.post("/signup", response_model=UserOut)
def sign_up(user: User):
    user_list.append(user)
    return user
```

By modifying the earlier POST function by adding `response_model=UserOut` the framework will filter the User object according the the response model, in this case, `UserOut`. Thus, the password will be filtered out. 


## Tasks
The task will be to create schemas for a library

1. Create a file named `schemas.py` and copy the `import` statements and `BaseSchema` from the examples

2. Create a schema to add books to the library
    * A book has a title, an author, an ISBN and text

3. Create a POST route to be able to add books to a list
    * Remember that POST routes return the object it just created

4. Create a schema for browsing the library (viewing all books)
    * When you are browsing for books you only want the title and the author, not the ISBN and definitly not the text

5. Create a GET route for browsing the library.

6. You will also want to view a specific book. Create a GET route which returns a book based on ISBN.
    * You do not have to consider the case of someone typing in the wrong ISBN

## Hints

1. Don't forget to inherit from `BaseSchema` and to declare the types.

1. Remember to import your `schemas`. Don't forget to specify the `response_model` or look in lesson 2.

1. Look in lesson 1 for how to do GET routes

## Solution
The file `schemas.py`
``` py 
from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict


# Inherit from when creating Pydantic Models
class BaseSchema(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)
    # This model_config lets pydantic validate a databse model


class Book(BaseSchema):
    title: str
    author: str
    ISBN: int
    text: str


class BookBrowse(BaseSchema):
    title: str
    author: str
```

The file `main.py`
```py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from schemas import Book, BookBrowse


app = FastAPI()

books: list[Book] = []


@app.post("/book", response_model=Book)
def addBook(book: Book):
    books.append(book)
    return book


@app.get("/catalogue", response_model=list[BookBrowse])
def getCatalogue():
    return books


@app.get("/book/{ISBN}", response_model=Book)
def getBook(ISBN: int):
    for book in books:
        if book.ISBN == ISBN:
            return book

```
