# Database Models

Our server needs a way to store data like news, songs and user info. This is the job of the database. We will use a type of database called SQL database. It stores data in a table format. Each <em>column</em> describes a property, like the <b>name</b> of a user. Each <em>row</em> represents an object we'd like to store, like a <b>user</b>.

To avoid gnarly details of speaking directly to the database, we will use an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) called SQLAlchemy. This lets us work on Python objects to modify our data, while the ORM handles the lower level operations.

We'll define the database models in a separate file `database.py`. Here is an example of how to define a database model:

```py
from typing import Optional
from sqlalchemy import String
from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase, MappedAsDataclass, Mapped, mapped_column


class BaseModel_DB(DeclarativeBase, MappedAsDataclass):
    pass


class Book_DB(BaseModel_DB):
    __tablename__ = "book_table"

    # Integer value, makred as primary key. Every table need one primary key column.
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True, init=False)

    # String value, max length 200
    title: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(200))

    # Integer column
    page_count: Mapped[int] = mapped_column()

    # Float column
    rating: Mapped[float] = mapped_column()

    # Optional (Nullable) string column. Instances of Book_DB will have a summary type of str or None.
    summary: Mapped[Optional[str]] = mapped_column(default=None)

    # A default value can be provided.
    read_times: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(default=0)

```


## Writing to database

We create instances of a database models and feed desired values into the constructor like:

```py
new_book = Book_DB(title="Moby Thicc", page_count=150, rating=8.6)
```

Note about this line:
- A column with `init=False` cannot be entered here. This is desired since we don't decide the `id`. The database does.
- A column with `default=<something>` is not required, but may be passed if we want to.

Creating an instance of our database model will however not save it into database automatically. It has not left Python-land yet. For this we need a database session in which we can talk and send data to database. Our route function <em>Depends</em> on this <em>Session</em>.

```py

from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from db_models import Book_DB
from database import get_db
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

app = FastAPI()


@app.post("/book")
def create_book(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    new_book = Book_DB(title="Moby Thicc", page_count=150, rating=8.7)

    # new_book has no id here

    db.add(new_book)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(new_book)

    # database has now given new_book an id

    print('Book after adding', new_book)
    return new_book

```

`Depends` is a function from FastAPI. It will run whatever function we give it. We give it `get_db` which is our own function to get a session. The result from `get_db` is assigned to the parameter `db`.


Now we can do fun stuff with `db`!
- `db.add(new_book)` will stage our object for writing.
- `db.commit()` writes changes to DB.
- `db.refresh(new_book)` update `new_book`. The Python object only gets an `id` after being inserted into DB. Refresh to get the `id`.

Note, this is not a realistic POST route yet as we do not accept request data. Parameters to Book_DB are hardcoded.

## Reading from database

To fetch data from database, use `db.query()`. Here we define routes for requesting all books, or requesting one by id. The `book_id` is a <em>path parameter</em>.

```py
@app.get("/book")
def get_books(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    all_books = db.query(Book_DB).all()
    return all_books


@app.get("/book/{book_id}")
def get_one_book(book_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    one_book = db.query(Book_DB).filter_by(id=book_id).one_or_none()
    return one_book
```

`.one_or_none()` will either return a `Book_DB` or `None` depending on whether a book was found or not.


# Tasks
Write an API for creating and getting cars, vroom vroom.

The car should have the following columns:
- `id` of type `int`.
- `driver_name`, no longer than 250 characters.
- `milage`. When creating a new car like `Car_DB(<some argumets>)` it should default to 0.
- `num_seats`

Create a POST route for creating a `Car_DB` which is saved to a list.

Create a GET route for getting all `Car_DB` without returning driver_names.

# Hint
- What types should you give the columns?
- Check `Book_DB` for setting defaults.
- Make a `CarCreate` and `CarRead` schema
- Use `response_model=list[CarRead]` to filter your response.
