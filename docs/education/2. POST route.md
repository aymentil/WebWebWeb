# POST Route example
Let's break down this example of a POST route in FastAPI.

Say we want to have a list of user emails on our server, then we need a function to call when a user wants to sign up (In this case, add their email to the list). 
POST routes are usually called when new data is to be added to the server.


```py
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

email_list : list[str] = []

@app.post('/signup')
def signup(body: dict[str, str]):
    email_list.append(body["email"])
    return { 'message': 'User Added' }
```


`@app.post('/signup')` is a decorator telling our framework, FastAPI, that this function should be called upon every POST request to `/signup`.

A POST request will contain the data to be added to the server. This data is sent in the HTTP *body*. The function argument `body: dict[str, str]` will contain the body of the current POST request. 

Note: This type definition is quite vague and better practices will be shown in the next tutorial. 

## Tasks
Create an API for making tasks in TODO lists. Requrements:
* There should be two different lists, `fun_tasks` and `boring_tasks` to add tasks to. Which one is choosen by a path parameter.

* A task has a time and a description

* You should be able to view either list using a GET-request

## Hints

1. You need two routes, one POST-request and one GET-request

2. Path parameters are described in GET-route.md

## Solution
```py
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

# Let's pre-fill one task in each list
fun_tasks = [{"time": "Friday 15:00", "description": "Fredmans"}]
boring_tasks = [{"time": "Monday 13:00", "description": "Do endim"}]


@app.post("/addTask/{id}")
def addTask(id: str, body: dict[str, str]):
    new_task = {
        "time": body["time"], 
        "description": body["description"]
    }

    if id == "fun":
        fun_tasks.append(new_task)
    if id == "boring":
        boring_tasks.append(new_task)

    return new_task


@app.get("/getTasks/{id}")
def getTasks(id: str):
    if id == "fun":
        return fun_tasks
    if id == "boring":
        return boring_tasks

    return {"message": "no such list"}
```
