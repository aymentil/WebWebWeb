# POST Route example
Let's break down this example of a POST route in FastAPI.

Say we want to have a list of user emails on our server, then we need a function to call when a user wants to sign up (In this case, add their email to the list). 
POST routes are usually called when new data is to be added to the server.


```py
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

email_list : List[str] = []

@app.post('/signup')
def signup(body: dict[str, str]):
    email_list.append(body["email"])
  return { 'message': 'User Added' }
```


`@app.post('/signup')` is a decorator telling our framework, FastAPI, that this function should be called upon every request to `/signup`

`body: dict[str, str]` defines the parameter that will contain the HTTP body sent along a POST request. 

OBS: Note that as shown in the next tutorial, this type definition is quite vague and better practices will be shown in the next tutorial. 

```py
@app.post('/signup/{email}')
def signup(email: str, body: dict[str , str]):
  #Do something with body and email
  return { 'message': 'User Added' }
```
This would mean that in order to add the email “`email123`”, the user would go to `/signup/email123`.
