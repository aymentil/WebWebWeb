# Schemas example

Let's have a look at `Schemas` in FastAPI. 

If we look back at example 2, a body of type `dict[str , str]` would not be very helpful! Instead, we will use pydantic to structure our request and response data. FastAPI uses these pydantic models for validation. In this tutorial, we will  define all schemas in a file called `schemas.py`.

```py
from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict

# Inherit from when creating Pydantic Models
class BaseSchema(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)
    # This model_config lets pydantic validate a databse model


class User(BaseSchema):
    email: str
    name: str | None #A string or None
    password: str
```
If we, like the previous example, want to make signup POST route. But this time, instead of using only an email, we create a user object containing the email. 

```py
user_list: list[User] = []

@app.post("/signup")
def sign_up(user: User):
    user_list.append(user)
    return user
```

Using a model the HTTP body sent along with the POST request the framework validates that the data is structured in this specific way. 

Additionally, you typically want the response to be the data that you just created. We want to structure the response. This can be done using response models. 

```py
class UserOut(BaseSchema):
    email: str
    name: str | None
```

In this example, the UserOut model doesn't include the password because, usually, returning the password isn't something that the response should include. 

```py
# Now we import everything i schemas. You could also write from schemas import UserOut
# if you only wanted that specific model.
from schemas import *  

user_list: list[User] = []

@app.post("/signup", response_model=UserOut)
def sign_up(user: User):
    user_list.append(user)
    return user
```

By modifying the earlier POST function by adding `response_model=UserOut` the framework will filter the User object according the the response model, in this case, UserOut. Here the password will therefore be filtered out. 


## Tasks
The task will be to create schemas for a library

1. Create a file named `schemas.py` and copy the `import` statements and `BaseSchema` from the examples

2. Create a schema to add books to the library
    * A book has a title, an author, an ISBN and text

3. Create a POST route to be able to add books
    * Remember that POST routes return the object it just created

4. Create a schema for browsing the library website
    * When you are browsing for books you only want the title and the author, not the ISBN and definitly not the text

5. Create a GET route for viewing the cataloge of books

6. When you have borrowed a book you want to get it. Create a GET route which returns a book basen on ISBN.
    * You do not have to consider the case of someone typing in the wrong ISBN

## Hints
1. Go to solution

2. Don't forget to inherit from `BaseSchema` and to declare the types

3. Remember to import `schemas`. Don't forget to specify the return model or look in lesson 2.

4. Same as 2

5. Python is intelligent and can change between types when you use the return model

6. Look in lesson 1 for how to do GET routes

## Solution
The file `schemas.py`
``` py 
from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict


# Inherit from when creating Pydantic Models
class BaseSchema(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)
    # This model_config lets pydantic validate a databse model


class Book(BaseSchema):
    title: str
    author: str
    ISBN: int
    text: str


class BookBrowse(BaseSchema):
    title: str
    author: str

```
The file `main.py`
```py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from schemas import *


app = FastAPI()

books: list[Book] = []


@app.post("/book", response_model=Book)
def addBook(book: Book):
    books.append(book)
    return book


@app.get("/catalogue", response_model=list[BookBrowse])
def getCatalogue():
    return books


@app.get("/book/{ISBN}", response_model=Book)
def getBook(ISBN: int):
    for book in books:
        if book.ISBN == ISBN:
            return book

```
